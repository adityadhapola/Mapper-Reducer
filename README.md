# Mapper-Reducer
MapReduce programs will give you a chance to understand the complexity of MapReduce programming
Task 1 – (Count words by lengths) Write a MapReduce program to count number of short words (1-4 letters), medium words (5-7 letters) words, long words (8-10 letters) and extra-long words (More than 10 letters); and the partitioner is implemented such that short words and medium words are processed by the same reducer.
Task 2 – (Count word with in-mapper combining without preserving state across documents) Write a MapReduce program to count the number of each word where the in-mapper combining (without preserving state across documents) is implemented rather than an independent combiner.
Task 3 – (Count word with in-mapper combining with preserving state across documents) Write a MapReduce program to count the number of each word where the in-mapper combining (with preserving state across documents) is implemented rather than an independent combiner.
